# ROBA Architecture Inventory

Checkpoint: CP1
Date: 2026-05-16

This document records the current working architecture before refactoring. It is intentionally descriptive, not aspirational: the goal is to protect the working UI and capabilities while making later changes smaller and safer.

## Protected Rule

Refactors must not change visible UI, design, labels, navigation behavior, data compatibility, or app capabilities unless explicitly requested.

## Active Runtime Files

`index.html` is the active entry point.

It currently loads:

- `styles.css`
- `utils.js`
- `app.js`

Load order matters. `utils.js` defines globals used by `app.js`, then `app.js` boots the application.

## Quarantined Inactive Files

The previous top-level `js/` folder was not loaded by `index.html` and has been moved to `inactive_refactor/js/` in CP2.

Current inactive files:

- `inactive_refactor/js/main.js`
- `inactive_refactor/js/state.js`
- `inactive_refactor/js/render.js`
- `inactive_refactor/js/events.js`
- `inactive_refactor/js/persistence.js`

These appear to be part of a partial modular refactor. They should not be treated as source of truth until a later checkpoint intentionally adopts or removes them.

## Current Data Stores

The app uses IndexedDB:

- Database: `roba_db`
- Version: `3`

Object stores:

- `items`
- `wears`
- `meta`
- `outfits`
- `trash`

Important compatibility note: item colors may exist as both a legacy `color` string and newer `colors` array. Existing rendering supports both.

Detailed active data shapes are documented in `DATA_MODEL.md`.

## Active Code Areas

### `utils.js`

Shared browser globals:

- color helpers: `colorToHex`, `isColorDark`, `flowerSVG`, `colorPill`, `catIconSVG`
- formatting and safety: `formatDate`, `esc`
- pure dashboard calculations: `selectHighlights`, `computeMonthStats`, `getLast12MonthKeys`, `computeMonthlyAverage`
- UI helpers: `buildPaginator`, `toast`

These helpers are used directly by `app.js`.

### `app.js`

Main responsibilities:

- IndexedDB setup and helpers
- seed data and migration
- boot sequence
- view switching
- dashboard rendering
- wardrobe filters, cards, selection, deletion
- brands view
- item detail modal
- calendar and day modal
- favourites view
- item add/edit form
- log day flow
- trash, backup, import
- outfit history and builder
- footer stats
- occasions

### `styles.css`

Single active stylesheet for all views and components.

Important selector contracts:

- view switching depends on `.view` and `.view.active`
- nav state depends on `.nav-btn.active`
- modals depend on `.modal-bg.open`
- wardrobe cards depend on `.item-card`, `.wardrobe-grid`, `.ic-*`, `.pill-*`
- dashboard depends on `.stat-strip`, `.stat-card`, `.dash-highlights`, `.highlight-card`
- top bar responsiveness depends on horizontal scrolling on `nav`

## Current State Pattern

The app is mostly global browser functions and feature-level globals.

Examples:

- wardrobe state: `wrdPage`, `wrdSelectMode`, `wrdSelected`, `wrdActiveFilters`
- calendar state: `calYear`, `calMonth`
- item form state: `editingItemId`, `formUnits`, `unitCounter`
- log state: `logPieces`, `logItemCache`, `logDateInited`
- outfits state: `outfitBuilderPieces`, `historyOutfitsCache`, `historyIMap`, `historySort`, `smartSelectedItem`
- occasions state: `ocasionsList`, `logOcasioSelected`

This is not elegant, but it is understandable and working. Later checkpoints should group state by feature only when doing so is low-risk.

## Safe Refactor Order

Recommended next checkpoints:

1. Extract pure utilities only if behavior is byte-for-byte equivalent from the app's point of view.
2. Extract IndexedDB persistence only after utilities are stable.
3. Split feature rendering last, one feature at a time.

Avoid:

- introducing a global state manager
- changing HTML structure for architecture reasons
- renaming CSS classes used by existing rendering
- changing IndexedDB schemas without migration
- rewriting rendering logic while extracting files

## CP1 Status

No app behavior changes were made for this checkpoint.

# Architecture Re-Analysis — 2026-05-21 (CP11)

The original inventory above was written at CP1 when everything lived in two files (`utils.js` + `app.js`). After CP2–CP11 the codebase was modularised. This section records the current state without modifying the original.

## Active Runtime Files

`index.html` is still the single entry point. It now loads 12 scripts in this order:

| # | File | Lines | Responsibility |
|---|------|-------|----------------|
| 1 | `js/persistence.js` | 118 | IndexedDB open, schema upgrade, all DB helpers (`dbGet`, `dbPut`, `dbAdd`, `dbDelete`, `dbGetAll`, `dbGetIndex`, `migrateColorsToArrays`) |
| 2 | `js/utils.js` | 212 | Pure browser globals: color helpers, `esc`, `formatDate`, `flowerSVG`, `colorPill`, `catIconSVG`, `resolveColors`, `buildPaginator`, `toast`, dashboard calc helpers |
| 3 | `js/dashboard.js` | 150 | HTML builders and canvas renderer for the dashboard view: `buildStatStripHTML`, `statCardHTML`, `highlightCardHTML`, `buildMonthSummaryHTML`, `renderCPUChart` |
| 4 | `js/wardrobe.js` | 437 | All wardrobe constants (`CAT_LABELS`, `TYPES_BY_CAT`, `SEASON_LABELS`, `FORMAL_LABELS`, `STATUS_LABELS`), wardrobe state, filter bar, card rendering, chip filters, pagination |
| 5 | `js/brands.js` | 53 | `renderBrands`, `filterByBrand` |
| 6 | `js/favourites.js` | 68 | `renderFavourites`, `switchFavTab`, `renderFavItems`, `renderFavOutfits` |
| 7 | `js/calendar.js` | 253 | Calendar state, `renderCalendar`, `openDayModal`, navigation helpers |
| 8 | `js/log.js` | 342 | Log-day flow: piece picker, autocomplete, CPW display, `submitLog`, `loadDayHistory`, `deleteOutfit` |
| 9 | `js/outfits.js` | 960 | Outfit history (Historial), outfit builder, saved outfits (Guardats), two-step picker, accordion, nucleus chips |
| 10 | `js/seed.js` | 290 | Demo data: `RAW_ITEMS`, `RAW_OUTFITS`, `RAW_OCASIONS`, `buildItem`, `buildWears`, `mapSeason` — auto-boots on first load or DB version < 2 |
| 11 | `js/ocasions.js` | 436 | Ocasions tab: grid, detail view, pinned outfit dialog, log-ocasio picker |
| 12 | `js/app.js` | 1094 | Boot, nav/view switching, `renderDashboard`, item detail modal, item add/edit form, color selector, tag input, unit rows, retire/delete, trash, export/import, debug helpers |

Total active JS: ~4 400 lines across 12 files (down from ~4 300 lines in two files at CP1).

## IndexedDB

- **Database:** `roba_db_demo`
- **Version:** `3`
- **Stores:** `items`, `wears`, `meta`, `outfits`, `trash`
- Ocasions are stored as a JSON value inside `meta` (`key: 'ocasions'`), not as a separate store.
- Seed version tracked in `meta` (`key: 'seeded', version: 2`); re-seeds if missing or version < 2.

## Global State (unchanged pattern)

All state is still plain globals — no state manager, no module system. Feature-level grouping:

| File | State globals |
|------|--------------|
| `wardrobe.js` | `wrdPage`, `wrdSelectMode`, `wrdSelected`, `wrdActiveFilters`, `wrdFilterBarBuilt` |
| `calendar.js` | `calYear`, `calMonth` |
| `log.js` | `logPieces`, `logItemCache`, `logDateInited`, `acHiIdx` |
| `outfits.js` | `outfitBuilderPieces`, `historyOutfitsCache`, `historyIMap`, `historySort`, `smartSelectedItem`, `historialStackFilters` |
| `ocasions.js` | `ocasionsList`, `logOcasioSelected` |
| `app.js` | `editingItemId`, `formUnits`, `unitCounter`, `itemTags`, `itemColors`, `colorOptionsCache`, `retireContext` |

## Inactive / Quarantined Files

`inactive_refactor/js/` — partial earlier modular refactor, not loaded, retained for reference only (quarantined in CP2).

## Known Quality Notes (from CP11 audit)

- Color data exists in two formats: legacy `item.color` (string) and migrated `item.colors` (array). All read paths now handle both; `migrateColorsToArrays()` runs on boot.
- Most `dbGetAll`/`dbGet`/`dbPut` calls lack `.catch()` — silent failures possible on DB errors. Noted for a future defensive pass.
- Boot writes (`refreshLastWorn`, `recalcWearCounts`) are sequential; could be parallelised with `Promise.all()` without behaviour change.
- `buildFilterBar()` correctly guards against duplicate listener registration via `wrdFilterBarBuilt`.

## Protected Rule (still applies)

Refactors must not change visible UI, design, labels, navigation behaviour, data compatibility, or app capabilities unless explicitly requested.
